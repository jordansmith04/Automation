	I stand here ready to take you, Hayley, to be my wife, best friend and lifelong partner.  
	
	Together, I know we can accomplish anything and overcome any obstacle that’s thrown our way. Over the last three years, you have been my best friend and my biggest supporter, including moving across the country with me. You’ve always been able to see the best in me, even when I haven’t been able to see it myself. Your beautiful smile lights up my day and I always want to make you laugh.  
	
	From this moment on, I promise to give you the best life I can, full of happiness and adventure... and maybe some screaming children. I vow to kill ALL the spiders and to choose to love you every day, even when it’s not easy. I promise to support you, inspire you and be your partner in crime if you need a get-away driver. I pledge to keep these promises for all my days.
