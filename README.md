ParaBank is an open source practice website for User Interface automation.
The UI was automated using Cucumber, Selenium Web Driver and TestNG.
Please take a look at my feature files and the automation I used to run them as they show multiple techniques for interacting with the DOM elements, pulling the information back into the automation to compare values, and following the flow of the application to ensure behavior.
Additionally, please take a look at the helper methods I created to streamline the automation process as they show coding proficiency.
